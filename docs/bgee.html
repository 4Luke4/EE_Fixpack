<h2>Fixes for BGEE (including SoD)</h2>
<h3> String Fixes </h3>
<p> Textual changes were made to correct errors or reflect other changes: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The description for Carrion Summons indicated that it would summon &quot;1d2&quot; carrion crawlers, but it's not a 50-50 chance. The spell has a 65% chance to summon two, and as such the language has been generalized. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strref #26586)</span></li>
  <li>The Sun Soulbeam ability does not roll for an attack, it just hits, contrary to its description.<span class="bg2fp_modder"> (strrefs #31984, #32224)</span></li>
  <li>The ranger Charm Animal ability does not mention its duration.  <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strref #32228)</span></li>
  <li>Several of the  shapeshifting abilities and spells did not list all of their abilities; generally it was the weapon enchantment of their natural weapons.  <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strrefs #32329, #32889, #32246, #32247, #32262, #32263, #32264, #32265, #32266, #32267)</span></li>
  <li>The listed weight of Paralytic Bolt +1 is corrected. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(strref #52365)</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Mechanics Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The non-proficiency penalty for Shadowdancers and Mage-Thieves were incorrect. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(clswpbon.2da)</span></li>
  <li>Wing buffet/knockback effects were not being applied to all creatures who should be affected <span class="bg2fp_modder">(cdwb220.eff, cdwb225.eff, cdwb230.eff, cdwb3100.eff, cdwb470.eff, spin547.spl, spin658.spl, spin695.spl, spin854.spl, spin896.spl, spwi818.spl, spwi918.spl, spyanc01.spl)</span></li>
  <li>Items with poison effects would block their own effects on a poison-immune target. However, in some cases, they were also blocking other, non-poison-related effects which should still apply.<span class="bg2fp_modder"> (bdbelhi1.itm, bdbelhi2.itm, bdmisc1c.itm, bdplant.itm, bdpotn02.itm, potn48.itm, sw1p01.itm)</span></li>
  <li>Similar to the above, sleep and charms could also block unrelated effects when stopped by (half-)elven immunity.<span class="bg2fp_modder"> (gorwom1.itm)</span></li>
  <li>The slow caused by an otyugh hit was a disease effect, but was not being cured by various disease cures. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bddraggh.itm, bdotyg01.itm, bdotyg02.itm, otyugh.itm, pudden01.itm)</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Area Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The prisoner-killing lever in the Temple of Cyric could be accidentally triggered just by walking up to it. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bdlever2.bcs)</span></li>
  <li>The special music for the Lady's House in BG was not playing. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(ar0132.are)</span></li>
  <li>Several creatures were placed on impassable terrain, making them unable to move, or outside the bounds of the area. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(ar0500.are, bd0020.are, bd5000.are)</span></li>
  <li>Footstep sounds were not being played in the Ducal Palace basement and one of the tutorial areas due to a bad ambient flag. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bd0116.are, tu0018.are)</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Dialogue Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Several generic Beregost commoner dialogues were supposed to comment on the death of Basillus, but the check for his death was incorrect. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(ftowbe.dlg, mtowbe.dlg, mtowbez.dlg)</span></li>
  <li>One of the Beregost commoners who threatens to call her Flaming Fist husband was checking the wrong variable to see if he was dead.  <span class="bg2fp_modder">(ftowbe.dlg)</span></li>
  <li>Tiax could have a No Valid Links Or Replies error if you spoke to him while he was charmed. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(tiax.dlg)</span></li>
  <li>Glanma and Oberan would have nothing to say on repeat visits. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(glanma.dlg, oberan.dlg)</span></li>
  <li>Perdue says he's giving you 50 gold in his dialogue, but only delivers if you had accepted the quest prior to returning his sword. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(perdue.dlg)</span></li>
  <li>If Silke survives until chapter seven, she will speak with you as if she's at the coronation in Baldur's Gate. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(silke.dlg)</span></li>
  <li>You can only tell the spirit in the bugbear cave to kill the bugbears if they're still alive. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bdshadow.bcs, bdshadow.dlg)</span></li>
  <li>Some of the dialogue triggers for comments in the blind albino cave were a bit loose and could fire elsewhere. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bd5100aw.bcs, bddynahj.dlg, bdjaheij.dlg, bdminscj.dlg, bdmkhiij.dlg)</span></li>
  <li>Some NPCs have comments in Korlasz' Tomb, but on lower difficulties the threshold for them to comment was too high as too many enemies would despawn. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bd0120.bcs)</span></li>
  <li>In the Lich Outpost, Neera's comment is checking the wrong state of the skull. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bd2000.bcs)</span></li>
  <li>An SoD Minsc-Rasaad banter was not properly checking for Rasaad, missing the banter. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bdminsc.bcs)</span></li>
  <li>At the beginning of SoD, you can tell NPC to 'go back to the crypt entrance' when kicking them out, but it didn't actually make them do anything. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bdparty.bcs)</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Item Fix Roundup</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Improved Cloak of Protection +2 was available in the Black Pits, and could be worn with other magical armor or rings. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(itemexcl.2da)</span></li>
  <li>The generic light crossbow lacked a <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/gallery/image/820-light-crossbow-icon-fix/">larger, shadowed icon</a>. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(ixbow04.bam)</span></li>
  <li>Imoen and Mordaine were using an odd copy of the Wand of Missiles, which meant it may not be covered by AI scripts or item checks. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(imoen1.cre, imoen2.cre, imoen4.cre, imoen6.cre, mordai.cre)</span></li>
  <li>The Clasp of Helm should be casting Detect Illusion at the point of the caster's choosing, not forcing it on the caster <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bdamul06.itm)</span></li>
  <li>Per their description, Energy Blades should do missile damage, not slashing.<span class="bg2fp_modder"> (eneblade.itm)</span></li>
  <li>The Elixir of Health was setting the intoxication level to zero instead of outright curing the effect. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(potn17.itm)</span></li>
  <li>The sirine item redundantly set intelligence to 3 alongside a feeblemind effect, meaning that curing feeblemind would still leave the target at 3 INT. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(sirine.itm)</span></li>
  <li>The copy of the Wand of Magic Missiles shouldn't bypass Shield. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(wand12.itm)</span></li>
  <li>The Longtooth dagger is described as exceptionally long and uses a short sword animation, but the range was still that of a dagger. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(dagg04.itm)</span></li>
  <li>The Paralytic Bolt +1 used the wrong save, wrong weight, wrong stun duration, and wrong dispellability, and wrong magic resistance check. Otherwise it was dandy. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(sahbolt.itm)</span></li>
  <li>On 10% of hits Neera's Staff was supposed to inflict a point of fire damage on its wielder <strong>or</strong> its target, but was instead inflicting a point of fire damage on both. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(stafn1.itm)</span></li>
  <li>Natural weapons (claws, bites, etc.) and magically-created weapons (e.g. Chill Touch) should not benefit from weapon style proficencies <span class="bg2fp_modder">(brblp.itm, brbrp.itm, brbrp1.itm, cdwolfm.itm, cdwstyl1.eff, cdwstyl1.spl, cdwstyl2.eff, cdwstyl2.spl, chillt.itm, critical.itm, druear.itm, drufir.itm, earthrn.itm, firern.itm, ghoult.itm, harm.itm, plybear1.itm, plybear2.itm, plymstar.itm, plyspid.itm, plyspid2.itm, plywolf1.itm, plywyvrn.itm, sgrasp.itm, slaylive.itm, squirp.itm, statdesc.2da, trollall.itm, wolfgr.itm, wolfm.itm)</span></li>
  <li>Goodberries should not play the *gulp* string when used as they are not potions <span class="bg2fp_modder">(gberry.itm)</span></li>
  <li>The nighttime THAC0 bonus from the Night Club could stack multiple times <span class="bg2fp_modder">(blun38.spl)</span></li>
  <li>The Barbed Defense and Suncatcher could cause spurious 'one of the spells has failed' messages <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bdbarbde.spl, bdshld02.spl)</span></li>
  <li>The Sandthief's Ring for sale in the Black Pits had the wrong number of charges <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bpxith03.sto)</span></li>
  <li>Bulk fixes:
    <ul>
      <li>Power (power determines how an item interacts with spell protections): Various summoned weapons are set to zero power (energy blades, flame blade, fire seeds, ghol touch, Melf's Minute Meteors); several wands are changed to power 1 to better match thier effects (Wands of Fear, Magic Missiles, Sleep) <span class="bg2fp_modder">(eneblade.itm, fblade.itm, fireseed.itm, ghoult.itm, melfmet.itm, wand02.itm, wand03.itm, wand08.itm, wand12.itm)</span></li>
      <li>Enchantment (enchantment determines if a weapon can strike a creature that requires +x weapons): Sword of Balduran is a 0-enchantment weapon <span class="bg2fp_modder">(comps18.itm, sw1h18.itm)</span></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Spell Fix Roundup</h3>
<ul>

  <li>The various Cause Wounds spells should be touch range and not bypass magic resistance. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(critical.itm, harm.itm, serious.itm, slaylive.itm, sppr599.spl, sppr699.spl)</span></li>
  <li>The fear effect attached to some ogres has a fear portrait icon that expires before the fear itself. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bdfear.spl)</span></li>

  <li>Some spells stack but shouldn't: Shield. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(spwi114.spl)</span></li>

  <li>Larloch's Minor Drain and Vampiric Touch had redundant checks for spell protections <span class="bg2fp_modder">(spin104a.spl, spin106a.spl, spin997a.spl, spwi119a.spl, spwi314a.spl)</span></li>

  <li>When Berserk was used for non-party members, the messages about the expiration damage was still being displayed as combat feedback. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(spcl321.spl, spcl321d.spl, spin117a.eff, spin117b.eff)</span></li>
  <li>Minsc's Berserk had a custom line from him that was not playing <span class="bg2fp_modder">(spin117.spl, spin117c.eff)</span></li>

<h3>Creature Fix Roundup</h3>
<ul>
  <li>BGEE changed how NPCs join, so that the player could choose weapon proficiencies, thieving abilities, and the like. However, as part of this, they did not include the better equipment that higher-level NPCs spawned with--e.g. Ajantis would wear chain, splint, or plate depending on when you recruited him. This is now addressed. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(ajantis.bcs, dorn.bcs, edwin.bcs, eldoth.bcs, imoen.bcs, jaheira.bcs, kagain.bcs, khalid.bcs, minsc.bcs, montaron.bcs, safana.bcs, sharteel.bcs, skie.bcs, viconia.bcs)</span></li>
  <li>Dorn and Neera could spawn without items due to an odd way they could change areas.<span class="bg2fp_modder"> (dorn.dlg, neera.dlg)</span></li>
  <li>Several party members had the wrong values assigned to their kit field despite being unkitted. This could cause minor issues with scripting and spell learning. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(ajanti.cre, ajanti4.cre, ajanti6.cre, alora.cre, alora6.cre, coran.cre, coran5.cre, imoen1.cre, imoen2.cre, imoen4.cre, imoen6.cre, kivan.cre, kivan4.cre, kivan6.cre, sharte.cre)</span></li>
  <li>Elemental summons shouldn't grant XP if killed. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(elemchan.cre, elemsunn.cre, 
elemzaam.cre)</span></li>
  <li>Bears summoned via Conjure Animals used generic bear scripting and lacked  the normal scripting of summons. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bearposu.cre)</span></li>
  <li>Ankhegs had an abnormally low HD, making them subject to sleep amongst other issues. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(ankheg.cre, ankhegf.cre, ankhegg.cre, ankhegq.cre, bdankh01.cre, bdankheg.cre, bdankhsu.cre, bdneo.cre, bpankhe1.cre)</span></li>
  <li>Poison Mists could spawn normally, but all of them used the summoned gender. This meant that they could be killed without checks by Death spell. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(mistpo01.cre, mistposu.cre, sppois.eff)</span></li>
  <li>Telania's petrified victims had leftover player scripting, meaning they could potentially try to join the party. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bdpetr01.cre, bdpetr02.cre, bdpetr03.cre, bdpetr04.cre, bdpetr05.cre)</span></li>
  <li>Ordulian has his cloak, but also creates a new one to give the player, potentially opening up a pickpocket/duplicate exploit.<span class="bg2fp_modder"> (orduli.cre)</span></li>
  <li>One of the mutated carrion crawlers and a magma mephit attacked without weapons due to typos.<span class="bg2fp_modder"> (bdmcarri.cre, mepmag.itm)</span></li>
  <li>Nishruu and hakeashar should be destroyed by dispel magic, their attack used the wrong type, they had some basic creature errors (general, race, class, animation, resistances) and some other minor errors. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(haksu.cre, nishruu.itm, nishru01.bcs, nishrusu.cre, spcl231.spl, specific.ids, spin112.spl, sppr303.spl, spwi302.spl, spwi326.spl) </span></li>
  <li>Bulk fixes:
    <ul>
      <li>Class (note that monsters can use special, non-player classes for identification): Krystin and Tellan are mages; Fahrington is a druid; Kiel the Legion Killer is a doppleganger; Kaishas Gan is a werewolf <span class="bg2fp_modder">(dopkie.cre, fahrin.cre, kaish2.cre, kaisha.cre, krysti.cre, tellan.cre)</span></li>
      <li>General: Andris is a humanoid <span class="bg2fp_modder">(andris.cre)</span></li></ul></li>
</ul>
<h3>Quest Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The Den of Thieves quest could reset its main quest tracking variable in some dialogue branches, breaking the quest. Threatening Waizahb as a paladin would also prevent creatures appearing, which could also stall the quest. <span class="bg2fp_modder"> (bdstoneh.dlg, bdwaizah.dlg)</span></li>
  <li>When trying to find the traitor in the siege camp, you could continue to question suspects even if you already identified and dealt with the traitor. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bdbelega.dlg, bdhalasa.dlg, bdhelvda.dlg, bdmizhen.dlg, bdsimone.dlg)</span></li>
  <li>Kharm offers you a reward for finding his nephew, but only delivers on on of the four replies. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bdkharm.dlg)</span></li>
  <li>At the end of the Candlekeep Catacomns, you find three dopplegangers imitating Elminster, Gorion, and Tethoril. If you one-shot kill one of them, the others will fail to transform and attack.<span class="bg2fp_modder"> (elmins4.bcs, ar2619.bcs)</span></li>
  <li>In the Menhir quest, if you failed at certain menhirs they would spawn an enemy. After defeating the enemy, the menhir was supposed to activate, but was not. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bdmenhi1.bcs, bdmenhi4.bcs)</span></li>
</ul>
<h3>Scripting/AI Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>If disguised dopplegangers were one-shot killed, they would still try to change into their doppleganger form. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(gdchange.bcs, ldchange.bcs)</span></li>
  <li>If you lure Aec'Letec out of its spawn area, most of the quest scripting breaks. The entrance to the area is now disabled while the fight is in progress. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(ar1002.bcs)</span></li>
  <li>The cultists with Aec'Letec were given shout scripts, which makes them move around. They should remain stationary. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(cultd1.cre, cultd2.cre, cultd3.cre, cultd4.cre, cultd5.cre, cultd6.cre)</span></li>
  <li>Xzar and Montaron can block all of the scripting in their area if they're not recruited, preventing other area events. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(ar2700.bcs)</span></li>
  <li>A few regions at the Boareskyr Bridge weren't being activated properly due to syntax errors. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bd2000.bcs, bdbarghe.bcs)</span></li>

<h3> Animation Fixes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>For larger creatures such as dragons, creature animations were typically split into four quadrants and stitched together on the game screen. Unfortunately, this could sometimes result in visible seams between the four disparate animations or, if a spell was in effect, animations cycling out of sync with one another. These larger animations have been merged into a single, monolithic animation to address these issues. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(all mdem*.bam, mdr1*.bam, mwyv*.bam)</span></li>
  <li>Similar to the above, large animations in areas could also be split and show the same seams where merged. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bdfug01.bam, bdfug02.bam, bdfug03.bam, bdfug04.bam)</span></li>

<h3>Polymorph Overhaul</h3>
<p>There were several ways that polymorphing--whether via a spell like Shapechange, a druid's natural abilities, or from an item like Cloak of the Wolf--could introduce numerous issues, especially when shifting directly between forms. A creature could retain stats or abilities from a previous form, or forced/voluntary/timed shapheshifts could overrun one another. As such, these abilities went through a complete overhaul designed to streamline the process, cover edge cases, and minimize issues. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(bdsw1h26.spl, bolt05.itm, brblp.itm, brbrp.itm, brbrp1.itm, brbrp2.itm, cdgoliro.itm, cdmindfl.itm, cdwolfm.itm, clck04.itm, clck04.spl, earthrn.itm, firern.itm, plybear1.itm, plybear2.itm, plyflind.itm, plyjelly.itm, plymstar.itm, plysala.itm, plyspid.itm, plyspid2.itm, plywolf1.itm, plywyvrn.itm, spcl611.spl, spcl612.spl, spcl613.spl, spcl632.spl, spcl633.spl, spcl634.spl, spcl643.spl, spcl644.spl, spcl731.spl, spdm103.spl,  spin107.spl, spin110.spl, spin111.spl, spin113.spl, spin122.spl, spin123.spl, spin124.spl, spin125.spl, spin126.spl, spin127.spl, spin150.spl, spin150r.eff, spin151.spl, spin152.spl, spin153.spl, spin154.spl, spin155.spl, spin156.spl, spin157.spl, spin160.spl, spin663.spl, spin717.spl, spin717a.spl, spin783.spl, spin783a.spl, spin822.spl, spin823.spl, spin823a.spl, spin852.spl, spin852a.spl, spin868.spl, spin869.spl, spin974.spl, spinhum.spl, spinhumr.spl, spinhums.eff, spinhums.spl, spinhumw.eff, spinhumw.spl, splprot.2da, splstate.ids, sppr110.spl, sppr206.spl, sppr213.spl, sppr414.spl, sppr510.spl, sppr511.spl, sppr608.spl, sppr614.spl, sppr721.spl, spwi115.spl, spwi117.spl, spwi218.spl, spwi325.spl, spwi415.spl, spwi416.spl, spwi489.spl, spwi489r.eff, spwi490.spl, spwi491.spl, spwi493.spl, spwi494.spl, spwi495.spl, spwi496.spl, spwi497.spl, spwi498.spl, spwi499.spl, spwi518.spl, spwi711.spl, spwi711a.spl, spwi915.spl, spwi916.spl, spwi920.spl, spwi952.spl, spwm113.spl, spwm113a.spl, spwm183.spl, squirp.itm, trollall.itm, wand09.itm, wolfchar.cre, wolfgr.itm, wolfm.itm, wswolf.itm)</span></p>
<h3>Probability Fixes</h3>

<h3>Revamp of Hold, Paralysis, and Web</h3>
<p>In the original Baldur's Gate, there were four internal methods to make an NPC freeze: paralysis (used in undead melee attacks), web (used by the spell of the same name and spiders), and two forms of hold (one for Hold spells and a second, special one reserved for special cases like cutscenes). As the series progressed through the BG expansion, into BG2, and concluding with Throne of Bhaal, these were used more and more freely, and muddled--you had web spells using paralysis, abilities that blocked the special hold (which nothing should) to the point where there was little distinction, if any, between these effects from a player's point of view. EEFP is re-establishing the scheme, going all the way back to the original Baldur's Gate, of trying to use these effects in a way that 
differentiates them and fixes a number of bugs along the way. Paralysis is, once again, the domain of undead attacks, and from which elves have some protection. Web is no longer paired by default with paralysis, meaning items which protect you from web no longer provide paralysis protection by accident, and the special hold will now always take effect. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(amul17.itm, antiweb.itm, bhaalhp1.itm, bhaalimm.itm, chalcy3.itm, dragring.itm, dwfpsirf.spl, enginest.2da, ghoul1.itm, ghoult.itm, immchs.itm, imoenhp1.itm, ipsion.itm, jwsuper.itm, mage05.itm, magiweb.itm, minhp1.itm, ohsmode1.spl, ohsmode4.spl, ring94.itm, ring95.itm, ring97.itm, ring98.itm, ring99.itm, ringkora.itm, sengua04.itm, sirine1.itm, spcl152.spl, spcl233b.spl, spcl242.spl, spcl321.spl, spcl742.spl, spdr201.spl, spin117.spl, spin683.spl, spin872.spl, spin906.spl, spin988.spl, sppr208.spl, sppr305.spl, sppr508.spl, sppr989.spl, spwi215.spl, spwi306.spl, spwi324.spl, spwi507.spl, spwm122.spl, trollimm.itm)</span></p>
<h3>Immunity and Cure Fixes</h3>
<p>In the original Baldur's Gate II engine, something that made you 'immune to X' was actually fairly limited: you could make the character directly immune to the effect and (typically) the normal portrait icon, but many of the ancillary effects (sound effects, visuals, etc.) were hit or miss. A party member under free action would resist being paralyzed by a ghast, but the sound effect that plays when the paralysis was supposed to expire would still play. Similarly, creatures immune to confusion would resist the confusion itself but still play a spinning animation over their head for the spell's intended duration. Thankfully, the EEs provide more tools for dealing with immunities, and we can  block all of these subsidiary effects. A parallel issue occurred when removing or curing effects. If you used Remove Fear on a panicking creature, the spinning animation over their head didn't always go away or the expiration sound would still play. Using a new EE feature, these subsidiary effects can be removed when the main effect is removed. <span class="bg2fp_modder">(#cureber.spl, #curebld.spl, #curecon.spl, #curedef.spl, #curedis.spl,

<h3>Internal Fixes</h3>
<p>This is a roundup of fixes that primarily impact modders and are not visible to players. </p>
<ul>
  <li>The Neothelid lacked an ini file and correct animate/anisnd.ids entries. (3001.ini, animate.ids, anisnd.ids)</li>
  <li>Several of the splprot.2da entries (specifically, alignment checks) were mislabeled. (splprot.2da)</li>
  <li>Several entries were added to spell.ids to enable easier scripting. (spell.ids)</li>
  <li>Kit ability tables for the archer, dark moon monk, and sun soul monk had missing entries for some columns. (clabmo02.2da, clabmo03.2da, clabrn02.2da)</li>
  <li>The area script for Coast Way Crossing (SoD version) has an OR(4) block with only two conditions. (bd1000.bcs)</li>
  <li>The first level of the Cloakwood Mines had a bunch of corrupt junk in its rest spawn block, which is cleaned up. (ar1801.are)</li>
  <li>Misindexed items and spells were fixed. (ption41.itm, spin158.spl)</li>
  <li>The unused princess item blocked confusion, but not the confusion visual effect. (princess.itm)</li>
  <li>The expiration sound for the cutscene sleep spell doesn't match the sleep duration. (bdsleep.spl)</li>
  <li>Various spells use feedback (op139) with non-permanent timing or non-zero durations. (bdshriek.spl, spin878.spl, spin893.spl, spin929.spl, spin931.spl, spwi714.spl, spwm178.spl)</li>
  <li>Effects with permanent timing shouldn't have durations (spin672.spl, spin878.spl, spin927.spl, sppr202.spl, spwi303.spl, spwi888.spl)</li>
  <li>Grease had duplicate opcode 321 effects (spwi101.spl) </li>
  <li>Detect Evil no longer gets routed through a subspell. On the originals, only evil creatures got checked for magic resistance, which let you know that any 'magic resistance' creature was evil. On the EEs, everyone gets checked which means this is no longer a free check. (spcl212.spl, spin120.spl, sppr101.spl, spwi202.spl)</li>
  <li>Sleep icons are folded into op 39 directly on various sleep effects (spin940.spl, spwi004.spl, spwi213.spl, spwi411.spl, spwm187.spl)</li>
  <li>Removed duplicate  opcodes from various spells (spcl722.spl, spdr301.spl, spin710.spl, spin714.spl, spin920.spl, sppr111.spl, sppr319.spl, sppr508.spl, sppr517.spl, sppr613.spl, sppr701.spl, sppr704.spl, sppr717.spl, sppr717a.spl, spra302.spl, spra303.spl, spwi002.spl, spwi222.spl, spwi308.spl,  spwi311.spl, spwi318.spl, spwi511.spl, spwi522.spl, spwi618.spl, spwi701.spl, spwi723.spl, spwi902.spl, spwi997.spl)</li>
  <li>'Bypass mirror image' flags were set on a number of opcodes that don't support it (spin673.spl, spin940.spl, spwi004.spl, spwi016.spl, spwi213.spl, spwi502.spl, spwm187.spl)</li>
  <li>Spells which use improved invisibility will no longer set normal invisibility as it's redundant(spwi405.spl, spwi505.spl, spwi721.spl)</li>
  <li>Several spells that used swarms of EFFs have been recoded with cleaner 326 implementations  (sppr313.spl, sppr314.spl, sppr707.spl, sppr707a.spl, sppr707b.spl, sppr707c.spl, sppr710.spl, sppr715.spl)</li>
  <li>Remove various duplicated protection/immunity opcodes (amul17.itm, bdbeltel.spl, bdddoorx.spl, bddraggh.itm, bddrggra.itm, bddrggry.itm, bdforcew.spl, bdleat05.itm, bdmisc05.itm, bdneoimm.itm, bdring09.itm, bdringge.itm, bdringgh.itm, bdsper1a.spl, bdspirim.itm, bdspnaim.itm, bdtelwe.spl, bdwyv03.itm, bhaalhp1.itm, bhaalimm.itm, chalcy3.itm, clck04.itm, dragring.itm, gorchr.itm, imoenhp1.itm, ipsion.itm, jwsuper.itm, minhp1.itm, ohtmps2d.spl, ohtmps2e.spl, potn21.itm, potn23.itm, potn25.itm, potn32.itm, potn33.itm, potn40.itm, potn45.itm, potn46.itm, ref1.itm, ring09.itm, ring94.itm, ring95.itm, ring99.itm, scrl07.itm, scrl09.itm, scrl10.itm, scrl11.itm, scrl12.itm, scrl13.itm, scrl18.itm, scrlpet.itm, sengua04.itm, spcl121.spl, spcl144.spl, spcl152.spl, spcl321.spl, spcl542a.spl, spcl611.spl, spcl612.spl, spcl613.spl, spcl632.spl, spcl633.spl, spcl634.spl, spcl643.spl, spcl644.spl, spdwd02.spl, spin117.spl, spin122.spl, spin123.spl, spin124.spl, spin823.spl, spin852.spl, spin952.spl, sppr111.spl, sppr508.spl, sppr613.spl, sppr701.spl, spra302.spl, sprngb03.itm, sprngb04.itm, sprngl03.itm, sprngl04.itm, sprngs01.itm, sprngs02.itm, sprngs03.itm, sprngs04.itm, sprngz05.itm, spwi222.spl, spwi311.spl, spwi491.spl, spwi511.spl, spwi618.spl, spwi701.spl, spwi705.spl, spwi723.spl, surehp1.itm, trollimm.itm, wand19.itm)</li>
